# Agenda_de_contact C# sqlite database

## This project is meant to act as a contact list that you can _"use"_

I made this project during the second-year practicum at Iulia Hasdeu College. 
This is a simple CLI app made with help of tutorials that thought me what is MVC and how to trivially use sqlite.
